# An Alternate Go Gopher Amigurumi Pattern
[The Go Gopher](https://blog.golang.org/gopher) is the iconic mascot of the Go programming language.

This [updated pattern](pattern.md) is a fork of an [original pattern](https://github.com/sillecelik/go-gopher) by Sille Celik. It's been made to look **more like the older, chubbier version of the Go Gopher.**
